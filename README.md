# Arctic_analysis
This contains all of the scripts that I used to look at my Dissertaiton "Chapter 2" work on seasonal to decadal changes in phytoplankton communities throughout the Arctic Ocean. These use MARBL-SPECTRA runs using CORE2 forcing between 1948 to 2009. 

Not all of these scripts are used in the manuscript, but they were all part of the process. 

Files are not included here, as I used access to derecho in NCAR which is where all those files are housed.
